## Begin with a statement addressing why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module

* Classes and Objects are important for creating reusable and modular code, Pytest Fixtures are important for setting up consistent test environments, and Coverage is important for ensuring comprehensive testing of your code.

## Reading  Questions

1. ### How can the random module be utilized in Python to generate random numbers or make selections from a list, and what are some common functions available within the module?

    * The random module in Python can be used to generate random numbers or make selections from a list.

    * To generate a random integer, the randint() function can be used, which takes two arguments representing the range of integers to select from.

2. ### In the context of software development, what is risk analysis, and what are the key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis for a software project?

    * Risk analysis in software development is the process of identifying, evaluating, and mitigating potential risks that may affect the success of a project.

    * The key steps involved in conducting a risk analysis include identifying potential risks, assessing their likelihood and impact, prioritizing risks based on their severity, developing strategies to mitigate or avoid risks.

3. ### What is test coverage and why is it an important (or potentially misleading) metric in software testing?

    * Test coverage is a metric used in software testing to measure the percentage of code or functionality that is tested by a set of test cases.

    * It is an important metric because it can help identify areas of a codebase that are not adequately tested and may be more prone to defects or bugs.

4. ### What is Big O notation, and how is it used to describe the performance of an algorithm? Give an example of an everyday task (not software related) that demonstrates O(n) time complexity?

    * Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance of an algorithm, usualy with respect to its time complexity.

    * It is used to express the upper bound of the number of operations an algorithm requires to solve a problem as the size of the input increases.

    * An example of an everyday task that demonstrates O(n) time complexity is finding a specific book on a bookshelf. As the number of books on the shelf increases, the time required to find a specific book increases linearly.
