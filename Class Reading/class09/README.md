## Begin with a statement addressing why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module

* by learning about code attribution and utilizing the Python statistics module, we gain not only the technical skills required for data analysis but also the ethical and professional understanding of proper code usage and attribution, which is crucial in the software development and data science domains.

## Reading  Questions

### 1. What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method?

* The purpose of dunder methods, is to provide functionality that can be customized for objects of a specific class.
  
* These methods are automatically called by Python in response to certain events or operations, such as object creation, attribute access, comparison, and mathematical operations. They allow us to define the behavior of objects and make them behave like built-in Python types.

* One commonly used dunder method is **__ init __** , which is used to initialize an object when it is created. It is called automatically when an object is instantiated from a class and allows us to set initial values for the object's attributes.

### 2. In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?

* The main ethical issue raised in the given article is the lack of proper attribution and credit given to developers whose work Suraj Raval used in his videos and courses.

* Suraj was accused of taking code from other developers, making minimal changes, and presenting it as his own without providing proper credit to the original authors.

* This ethical issue could have been avoided by following standard practices of giving credit and attribution in the field of software development.

* When using code or any other work created by someone else, it is important to acknowledge and attribute the original author or creator.

### 3. Describe the Python statistics module and give an example of a function within the module that can be used to perform a common statistical operation?

* The Python statistics module is a built-in module in Python that provides a set of functions for mathematical statistics and data analysis.

* It offers various statistical operations, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, correlation, and more.

### Example

```python
import statistics

data = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

mean_value = statistics.mean(data)
print("Mean:", mean_value)
```
