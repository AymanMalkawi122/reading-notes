## Reading  Questions

### 1. What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

* Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions:

    DRF permissions are a key component that allows developers to control access and secure APIs. They define rules for granting or denying access to specific views or API endpoints based on various conditions. DRF provides several built-in permission classes, such as IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly, and custom permission classes.

* Purpose of DRF permissions:

    DRF permissions play a crucial role in securing APIs by enforcing rules like authentication, authorization, and access control. They ensure that only authorized users or groups can perform specific actions on API resources, preventing unauthorized access and potential security vulnerabilities.

* Usage of DRF permissions:

    To use DRF permissions, you can specify them in the permission_classes attribute of a Django view or API viewset. For example, to require authentication for accessing a view, you can use the IsAuthenticated permission class

### 2. In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

* Purpose of the SELECT statement in SQL:
The SELECT statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database table. It allows you to query and fetch specific columns and rows from a table based on certain conditions.

* Retrieve all columns from the 'employees' table:
To retrieve all columns from the 'employees' table, you would use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

### 3. Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

* DRF Generic Views:

    DRF Generic Views are a set of pre-implemented views provided by Django Rest Framework. They offer simple, reusable views for common tasks, reducing the amount of code required to build RESTful APIs.

* Role of DRF Generic Views:

    DRF Generic Views streamline API development by providing default implementations for common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. They map HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the corresponding actions on the API views, simplifying the process of creating API endpoints.

For example, to create a simple API view for listing all objects of a model:

```python
Copy code
from rest_framework.generics import ListAPIView
from .models import MyModel
from .serializers import MyModelSerializer

class MyModelListView(ListAPIView):
    queryset = MyModel.objects.all()
    serializer_class = MyModelSerializer
```

Here, ListAPIView provides the default implementation to list all objects of the MyModel model and serialize them using the MyModelSerializer. Similarly, DRF Generic Views offer other view classes like CreateAPIView, RetrieveAPIView, UpdateAPIView, and DestroyAPIView, making it easy to create views for various API operations with minimal code.
