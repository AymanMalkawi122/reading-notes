# WHY:

Stacks and queues are fundamental data structures in computer science that help in organizing and managing data in specific ways. They are designed to solve different types of problems efficiently and provide predictable behavior for accessing and manipulating data elements.

# WHAT:

1. Stack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It resembles a physical stack of objects, where the last item placed on top is the first one to be removed. New elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack. Stacks are commonly used in scenarios that require maintaining a specific order of operations, such as function call stacks, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.

2. Queue: A queue is also a linear data structure, but it follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It resembles a physical queue of people waiting in line, where the first person to join is the first one to be served. New elements are added at one end, known as the "rear" of the queue, and removed from the other end, known as the "front" of the queue. Queues are commonly used in scenarios that involve scheduling, buffering, and resource allocation.

# HOW:

## 1. Stack:

- To create a stack, you can use either an array or a linked list.
- Elements are added to the top of the stack using the "push" operation, and they are removed from the top using the "pop" operation.
- The "peek" operation allows you to access the top element without removing it.
- Stack operations include push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
- Implementations of stacks can vary, such as a fixed-size stack or a dynamically resizing stack.

## 1. Queue:

- Similar to stacks, you can implement a queue using an array or a linked list.
- Elements are added to the rear of the queue using the "enqueue" operation, and they are removed from the front using the "dequeue" operation.
- The "peek" operation allows you to access the front element without removing it.
- Queue operations include enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty.
- Different variations of queues exist, such as priority queues and double-ended queues (dequeues).
