### 1. What is the primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and how do they work in terms of encoding and decoding data?

The primary purpose of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) is to securely transmit information between parties in a compact and self-contained way.

JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

They consist of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header typically contains the token's type (JWT) and the signing algorithm used.

The payload contains the claims (e.g., user information or permissions) that are digitally signed to ensure data integrity.

The signature is generated using a secret key known only to the server, which ensures that the token has not been tampered with during transmission.

The recipient can use the secret key to verify the token's authenticity and extract the information from the payload.

### 2. How does JWT Authentication integrate with Django REST Framework to secure API endpoints, and what are the key components involved in this process?

In Django REST Framework (DRF), JWT Authentication can be integrated to secure API endpoints. The key components involved in this process are:

* DRF's JSONWebTokenAuthentication: This is a custom authentication class provided by DRF that allows the use of JWTs for authentication.

* djangorestframework_simplejwt Library: This third-party library provides a simple and secure JWT implementation for Django REST Framework. It offers customizable token settings and token refreshing capabilities.

* TokenObtainPairView and TokenRefreshView: These views provided by the djangorestframework_simplejwt library are used to obtain and refresh JWT tokens. The TokenObtainPairView generates a token when a user provides valid credentials, while the TokenRefreshView refreshes the token when it's expired.

* JWT_SECRET_KEY and JWT_ALGORITHM: These settings in the Django settings.py file define the secret key and the hashing algorithm used for token generation and verification.

### 3. Why is Djangoâ€™s built-in runserver not suitable for production environments, and what are some alternative server options that should be considered for deploying a Django application?

Django's built-in runserver is a development server designed for ease of use during development and testing. However, it is not suitable for production environments due to several limitations:

* Single-Threaded and Not Production-Ready: The runserver is single-threaded, meaning it can only handle one request at a time, which can lead to poor performance and scalability issues in production.

* Lack of Security Features: The runserver does not provide all the security features required for a production server, such as HTTPS support and built-in security settings.

* Limited Configuration Options: The runserver has limited configuration options, making it less flexible for handling complex production environments.

Alternative Server Options for Deploying a Django Application:
For deploying a Django application in production, it's recommended to use a production-ready server. Some popular options include:

1. Gunicorn (Green Unicorn): Gunicorn is a pre-fork worker model HTTP server that is compatible with many web frameworks, including Django. It supports multiple workers, allowing concurrent handling of requests and improved performance.

2. uWSGI: uWSGI is a fast and powerful application server that can serve Django applications and offers various features, including load balancing, caching, and advanced process management.

3. Apache with mod_wsgi or Nginx with uWSGI: These web servers can be configured to work with Django using WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) for serving Python applications. They offer robust performance and support additional features like SSL/TLS termination and reverse proxying.
