### 1. How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?

Django Forms simplify user input handling in web applications by providing a Pythonic way to manage and validate user-submitted data. Key components of creating a form using Django include ModelForm for CRUD operations on database models, various form fields for user input, built-in validation, automatic form rendering in HTML templates, CSRF protection, data binding, and error handling. By leveraging Django Forms, developers can efficiently process user input, ensuring accurate and secure data handling in web applications.

### 2. Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability

Django Templates serve to separate presentation logic from business logic in web development. They allow dynamic content rendering by defining placeholders and tags filled with data during rendering. Template inheritance is a key feature that improves code reusability and maintainability by enabling the creation of a base template with common elements, inherited and customized by child templates. This approach promotes clean code architecture, reduces duplication, and ensures consistent design across the application, making updates and maintenance more efficient. Overall, Django Templates contribute to a modular, organized, and cohesive user experience in web applications.

### 3. Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views

Django Views handle HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses in web applications. They are responsible for processing user input, interacting with models or databases, and rendering templates to present data to the user. There are two types of views in Django: function-based views and class-based views. Function-based views are simple and straightforward, suitable for smaller projects with basic request-response handling. Class-based views offer more flexibility and reusability through inheritance and methods, making them suitable for larger projects with complex view requirements. The choice between function-based and class-based views depends on the project's complexity and the level of customization needed for request handling.
