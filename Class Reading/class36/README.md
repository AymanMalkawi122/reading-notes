## Reading  Questions

### 1. What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

***Communicate***: The most important skill to prepare for a whiteboard interview is effective communication. Before diving into solving the problem, take important steps such as restating the question to ensure you understand it correctly, asking about potential edge cases, inquiring about test cases, and discussing your pseudocode with the interviewer.

***Restate the Question***: Begin by rephrasing the problem to confirm your understanding. Seek affirmation from the interviewer, which not only ensures clarity but also helps calm nerves and set a clear direction for solving the challenge.

***Ask About Edge Cases***: Before writing any code, think about potential edge cases related to the problem and inquire about them. This demonstrates your analytical skills and attention to detail in preventing bugs.

### 2. From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

***Take a Few Minutes***: Instead of immediately diving into code, take a moment to gather your thoughts after the problem is presented. Politely inform the interviewer that you'd like to spend a minute or two thinking before you start discussing your approach. This brief pause allows you to internalize the problem, devise a strategy, and organize your thoughts before speaking. By taking this time, you'll enter the coding phase with a clearer plan in mind, leading to more effective communication and a higher-quality solution.

***Write Down Solution Steps***: Before writing code, outline the general steps of your solution on one side of the whiteboard. This step-by-step plan serves as a roadmap for your coding process and helps you maintain a clear structure while writing code. Writing pseudocode or basic algorithmic steps not only ensures that you stay on track but also helps you catch potential issues or logic flaws before they manifest in your code. This approach showcases your problem-solving thought process and serves as a solid foundation for writing the actual code.

### 3. What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

* Challenging Questions: Interview questions should be challenging because they are genuinely hard, not because they require obscure knowledge. Candidates should be tested on their problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and ability to deconstruct a problem.

* Hurdles and Logical Solving: Questions should have multiple hurdles or steps, requiring candidates to demonstrate how they approach and solve complex problems logically.

* Avoiding Tricks and Obscure Knowledge: Questions should not involve tricks or rely on knowledge that is rarely used in real-world coding. The focus should be on assessing a candidate's intelligence, problem-solving skills, and fundamental understanding of data structures and algorithms.

* Assessing Thought Process: McDowell emphasizes that interviewers should focus on assessing a candidate's thought process, how they approach a problem, and their ability to make progress even if they don't fully solve the problem.
