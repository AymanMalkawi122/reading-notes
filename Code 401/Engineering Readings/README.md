## Begin with a statement addressing why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module.
Coding, in the beginning, may seem difficult or counter-intuitive but with the right tools and mindset for learning and dealing with new obstacles it becomes second nature, that's why this topic is important because it demonstrates to us how to tackle large problems, break them down to sub-problems and the correct mentality to have because, learning to code is like a marathon rather than a race. 

## Discussion Questions
1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I consider myself a fast learner, have good intuition when it comes to solving problems, and never back down from a new challenge.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* Take a step back from coding and go back to design to think of a better solution or if I can break down, improve my current solution
* Get inspiration to change my way of thinking from professional solutions to problems similar to mine
* Try to think of or solve a problem similar to mine in principle but simpler in implementation
## Things I want to know more about

Learn more in detail about SOLID design principles and design patterns to be able to write code that is more maintainable and readable
